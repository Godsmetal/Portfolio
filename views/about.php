            <h1>About me</h1>
            <h2><span>Since graduating with a B.S in Information Technology at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), my focus in my professional career is to develop practical and functional applications for any problem.</span>
                <span>During a paid internship at <a href='https://www.clevermethod.com/' target='_blank'>clevermethod</a>, I had the responsiblity to develop web applications for the millions with the client <a href='https://www.sharkninja.com/' target='_blank'>SharkNinja</a>. The reward of knowing that your creation is being used by millions of people, is a feeling of accomplishment and creates a hunger to develop even larger applications to change the world.</span>
                <span>When not online, you can find me spending time with my family, practicing my <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/137704097@N04/' target='_blank'>photography</a> techniques, or in the online world of Azeroth.</span></h2>
